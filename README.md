# Learn Node.js and MongoDB 
This repository is a collection of tutorials and projects I'm working on to learn Node.js for backend development and MongoDB for database management. As a Flutter developer expanding into full-stack development, I aim to deepen my understanding of building complete applications by learning how to integrate a backend with a NoSQL database.

## Introduction
This repository documents my journey of learning how to build RESTful APIs using Node.js and how to store data using MongoDB. By combining this with my expertise in Flutter for frontend development, I aim to create complete full-stack applications.

## Technologies Used
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime for backend development.
* Express.js: Web framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
* MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing and managing application data.
* Flutter: Used for frontend in other projects.
* Setup Instructions
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sikandar897/learn-node-mongo.git

## Navigate to the project directory:
* cd learn-node-mongo

## Install dependencies:

* npm install

## Run the Node.js server:
* node server.js
### (Optional) MongoDB Setup: If you want to connect this app to MongoDB, ensure MongoDB is running locally or on a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas. Update the MongoDB connection string in the project.

## Learning Goals
* Build RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js.
* Understand how to integrate MongoDB into a Node.js application.
* Learn how to handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and manage responses.
* Explore data validation, error handling, and other best practices in backend development.
